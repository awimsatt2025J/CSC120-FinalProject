This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

The commands available are: go, grab, drop, and check.
The go command will move the player from room to room depending on the user input.
The grab command removes an item from the current location's inventory and adds it to the player's inventory
The drop command adds an item to the current location's inventory and removes it from the player's inventory
The check command checks if the current location's inventory is the needed inventory of the room

These are are correct objects for each room:

The computer science classroom: oneCard, Lazy Dog, Train, Memory Model
The biology classroom: Plant, Worm, Cell diagram, Petri dish
The engineering classroom: Saw, Hammer, Compass, 3d printer
The chem lab: Conical, Volumetric, Round-bottomed, Retort
