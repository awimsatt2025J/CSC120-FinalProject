# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
    Getting help and advice, simplifying the objective/concept of the game, not leaving this to be done at the last minute.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    Practicing/using the switch and case methods to analyze user input; practicing/using a hashtable

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
    Not really, but it would have been cool to make the project be able to have more than one set of current and needed objects for each room so that they wouldn't be the same for every game round, where the user would be able to play more than once (and not do the same things).

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
    We would add graphics.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    Simplifying the concept of our game - from Jordan.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
    We would tell ourselves to not over-estimate/over-complicate the project than what it had to be.
 
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
    Annie Wimsatt and Seychelle Brainard worked together on this project. Our team dynamics included good communication, accountability, willingness to try different ideas. It helped do the project more smoothly.
